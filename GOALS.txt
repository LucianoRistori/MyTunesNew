Goal

MTconvert:

Reads an input audio file (e.g. test_440.wav).
Normally writes spectrum data to a file (filename is given as input argument)
If filename is missing, writes to stdout to allow pipe to MTgraph and other possible future implementations
Optionally takes a PostScript filename as a command-line argument to produce a PS plot (e.g. "spectrum.ps").



MTgraph:

Reads the spectrum data file (filename is given as input argument)
If filename is missing, reads from stdin to allow pipe from MTconvert and other possible future implementations
Takes a PostScript filename as a command-line argument for the output image (e.g. "spectrogram.ps").
If no filename is given, defaults to spectrogram.ps


# Write spectrum to a file 
./MTconvert test_440.wav spectrum.txt

# Write spectrum to stdout (no PS file)
./MTconvert test_440.wav > spectrum.txt
